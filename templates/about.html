<h3>How it started:</h3><br>
<p>I woke up one day and since I was quarantined and didn't feel like doing school so I made something called <b>Bark</b>. Bark was a public board until I decided to name it Bark-IT with the promise of being better than twitter. Me and bigjango rewrote bark-it to have accounts and more, but it was poorly written and eventually we turned to flask to hopefully make things better. I started quite a while ago before writing this. I lost motivation until today, and today is everyday until Bark-IT passes twitter and restores hope and freedom to the internet....</p>
