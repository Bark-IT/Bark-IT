## About

I was quarantined one day so I made a crappy website and decided to rewrite it and make it open source.
The old code sucked so I thought I'd rewrite it.

## Credits

- Thanks to Bigjango for taking it upon themself to rewrite all the old features and optimizing my crappy code.
- Thanks to TheShadowDragon for using his javascript skills.
- Thanks to SkyKrye for making the main page.

## How to run

1. `pip3 install flask`
2. Open directory and type `flask run` or `python3 app.py` and hit enter
