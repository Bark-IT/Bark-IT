## about
I was quarantined one day so I made a crappy website and decided to rewrite it and make it open source.
The old code sucked balls so I thought I'd rewrite it since I was sick of people using html hacks to post porn. *COUGH* https://github.com/LordOfTrident *COUGH*.
At least the Bark-IT community is still better than twitter.
